Fuck it, we ball\
Wanted to make Minecraft, wanted to write C, wanted to use OpenGL, decided C++ was more convenient\
This is very spaghetti\
Likely not the most efficient either\
DEFINITELY not unique\
Totally didn't copy the greedy meshing code from some random research paper I found\
Eventually I will replace the UI draw calls with texture draw calls\
Not today tho

## AI Usage Disclaimer
I did use Copilot for the `CMakeLists.txt` and `main.yml` files (mainly because IDK the first thing about either).\
Copilot didn't touch the rest of my code, I did ask it questions on how to do XYZ, but it never generated code for me.\
***All code is written by me, someone who has never written C++ before and is generally not the best programmer ever, if there are security or memory issues, it is because of my dumbass. Please create an issue. Thanks <3***

./VoxelEngine
```

## Downloading Pre-built Binaries
Pre-built binaries for Windows and Linux are available at [Releases](https://github.com/Nadelio/VoxelEngine/releases/tag/latest-build).\
Steps:
